## Imported Code Object
In the given code snippet, `labelStyle` is likely a CSS class or an object representing styles that will be applied to the labels or tags associated with the tasks or cards in a Kanban board. The `/app/kanban/[slug]/page.tsx` part refers to the file path and the specific file where this code is defined. In Next.js, the `app` directory is used for creating the React components that make up the application's UI. The `kanban` directory within `app` suggests that it contains components related to a Kanban board feature or functionality. The `[slug]` part is a dynamic segment or parameter in the file path, which means that the component defined in `page.tsx` will render for any URL that matches the pattern `/kanban/some-value`. This allows for creating dynamic pages or components based on the provided `slug` value, which could be used to render different Kanban boards or workspaces. So, in summary, `labelStyle` is likely a style object or class used for styling the labels or tags on the Kanban board, and this code is defined in the `page.tsx` file within the dynamic route `/app/kanban/[slug]`, which is responsible for rendering the Kanban board based on the provided `slug` value.
